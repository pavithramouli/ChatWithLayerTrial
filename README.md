# ChatWithLayerTrial
A trial swift project with LayerSDK for iOS. Will be buggy.

1-1 chat. 1-n chat.
Login as any.
View conversation lists.
View conversation.
Add image.
Logout.

Known issues:
1) Log in as A, without logging out quit the app, relaunch and log in
as B. Conversation list retrieved is not all of Bâ€™s. Instead, log in as
A, logout and quit, relaunch and login as B, shows all conversations.
2) No methods to clear or delete chats.

Updates Planned:
1) Change from local notifications for updates to delegates. Will make life so much easier.
2) Add options to delete and clear chats. 
3) Try and check announcements.
